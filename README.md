The textarea feature allows users to interactively type their answers for flashcard questions and receive instant feedback. Here's a description of how the feature works:

Activation and Disabling: The textarea feature can be activated and disabled by selecting the corresponding option from the "select feature" menu. When activated, the feature enables the textarea element for input. When disabled, the textarea element is deactivated, preventing any further input.
